This is an Apple2e emulator written entirely in Java.  It is a subset
of a generic 6502 emulator, with front ends for Apple1, Apple 2, Apple ][ plus,
and Apple //e.  Included are all the resources needed to run the emulator,
as well as sample disks.

To build, and run, use gradle:

```
./gradlew run
```

You may need to update the SWT dependency for the architecture you are using.
