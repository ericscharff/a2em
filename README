This is an Apple2e emulator written entirely in Java.  It is a subset
of a generic 6502 emulator, with front ends for Apple1, Apple 2, Apple ][ plus,
and Apple //e.  Included are all the resources needed to run the emulator,
as well as sample disks.

Be sure to put the swt.jar in the lib directory:
  cd lib
  unzip ~/Downloads/swt-3.3-gtk-linux-x86.zip swt.jar
  cd ..
  ant run

Usage:
  java -cp build/jars/apple2.jar:lib/swt.jar a2em.Apple2e

or just
  java -jar build/jars/apple2.jar

if swt.jar is already in your CLASSPATH
